#Project Goal:
  Examine the correlation between different different soil phosphorus fractions and the carbon-based root exudates present in those same soils. This will allow for determination of plant investment in certain nutrient pools at different soil depths. 
  
#Topmost Design
  First I will need to import the data. Some of my data is in a .csv, while some is in a pdf. I would like to scrape the data from the pdf and append it to the .csv. For this I will have a function `data_import` that takes arguments specifying the pdf and the csv and merges them according the common colums of soil site/depth.
  `data_import <- function(pdf,csv)`
  
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
