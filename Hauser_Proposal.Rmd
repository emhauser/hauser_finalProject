#Abstract
#Introduction
Plant rooting systems have numerous mechanisms by which they obtain nutrients from soils. These mechanisms include increased root exploration of soil volumes, root hair proliferation, and the exudation of carbon(C)-based compounds, known as rooting system exudates, that may enhance nutrient availability when released into the soil profile (Marschner and Rengel 2007). Rooting system exudates perform differing chemical reactions in the soil matrix, which may alter the nutrient benefits recieved by the plant for its root-C investment (Smith 1976). For example, enzyme exudates release nutrient ions by cleaving monomers from organic matter, while organic acid exudates liberate nutrient ions via ligand exchange and desorption reactions with mineral surfaces (Bunemann 2011, Sato and Comerford 2006). Thus, one might expect to see greater production of acid exudates where nutrients are present in mineral forms and greater production of enzymes where organic matter dominates soil nutrient pools. However, these exudates require differing amounts of fixed plant C to produce, such that root systems may alter their belowground C allocation strategy to maximize nutrient gains for plant C-resource inputs. 
  The nutrient phosphorous (P) is an ideal model to examine these hypotheses because it is a critical plant nutrient that is available only from soil minerals until its incorporation into organic matter (Vitousek et al. 1997). This dichotomous nature permits examination of variations in plant root C allocation in response to mineral vs. organic nutrient pools. 
  Using extant soil chemistry and root density datasets compiled from the Calhoun Critical Zone Observoratory, I propose to examine the correlations between different soil phosphorus fractions, plant root density, and the carbon-based root exudates present in those same soils. This will allow for determination of plant investment in nutrient acquisition from organic vs. mineral nutrient pools across soil depth in ecosystems known to have differing land use histories. As such, this study will illuminate how human-driven changes in soil organic matter and mineral nutrient content alters the fate of fixed plant C in belowground systems. 

#Methods  
##Study site
I will conduct this study at the Calhoun Critical Zone Observatory, SC, which is home to both 200-year-old hardwood forests and ~80-year-old post-agricultural  pine forests (Fig. 1). As in most soils that do not contain buried O or A horizons, surface soils are relatively organic P(Po)-rich and harbor minerals with low P content; with increasing depth, relative abundances of mineral P (Pg) increase and Po decreases. In pine forests, Pg remains relatively high in surface horizons from agricultural erosion.

##Data Collection
From X forest replicates researchers collected soil samples from paired un-altered and post-agricultural field sites. Soils were analyzed for extractable organic C (EOC)--a proxy for organic acid concentration--in every soil horizon, root density in every square centimeter of soil depth, several fractions of organic and inorganic P that have varying degrees of availability as described by the Hedley (1982) fractionation method, and acid phosphatase activity at 5 fixed soil depths. For this analysis, I will restrict my computation to data from the first 2 meters of soil depth, as not all datasets include data beyond this depth. 

##Computational analyses
  First I will import the data using the `data_import()` function. This function takes arguments specifying the csv(s) to import, which will return dataframes of each response variable, `data_import <- function(workingDIR)`. 
  
  Some data is measured at fewer depth points than others, such that I do not have the same number of measurements at each depth in any given sampled soil profile. To model expected values at every depth in the soil profile, thereby filling out each response variable dataset, I will use the function `soil_extrapolate()`. This function--`soil_extrapolate <- function(datSet)`--will be looped over the datasets to make a smoothed curve of each response variable. Then it will extrapolate values at each cm depth interval, and return a dataframe of all the response variables generated from vectors produced in the loop.
  
Once datasets are interpolated and organized, I will correlate all the P-fractions of interest with each root exudate type, the ratio of exudate types, and root density. I have 8 P-fractions and 3 exudates (including the exudate ratio) each sampled in 2 land use types at multiple soil depths. This analysis will call the function `soil_stats <- function(P-fract, exudates)` in which you can specify the P-fractions of interest, in case you do not want to see all of them, and the exudates of interest. This function will find a correlation for each data point as well as the correlations of the mean values calculated according to depths and land use types. It will return the correlations in a table that also denotes the soil sampling site and depth. 

Using the correlations produced by `soil_stats()`, I will examine the patterns of correlation across soil depth and landuse type. For this, I will make plots showing soil depth vs. correlation between P-fraction and exudate for each land use type. For this I will use `soil_plot <- function(relate, landuse)` into which I specify which of the relationships from the `soil_stats` table I want to plot against soil depth, as well as the land use type of interest for the plot. The landuse argument will be able to take multiple arguments such that the hardwood landuse and the pine forest land use can be plotted on the same soil depth graph.
