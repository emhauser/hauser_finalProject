#Project Goal:
  Examine the correlation between different different soil phosphorus fractions, plant root density, and the carbon-based root exudates present in those same soils. This will allow for determination of plant investment in certain nutrient pools at different soil depths. 
  
#Topmost Design
  First I will need to import the data. Some of my data is measured at more depths, such that I do not have the same number of measurements at each depth in a sampled soil profile. I would like to make a function that imports the data, makes a smoothed curve, and uses this curve to extrapolate values of response variables between actual sampling points. First, I will have a function `data_import` that takes arguments specifying the csv(s) to import, which will return dataframes of each response variable, `data_import <- function(pdf,csv)`. I will then have a function 'soil_extrapolate <- function(datSet)` that will be looped over the datasets to make a smoothed curve of each response variable, extrapolate values at each cm depth interval, and return a dataframe of all the response variables generated from vectors produced in the loop.
  
Once the data is imported, I will want to correlate all the P-fractions of interest with each root exudate type as well as the ratio of exudate types. I have 4 P-fractions and 3 exudates (including the exudate ratio) each sampled in 2 land use types at multiple soil depths. This might have a function `soil_stats <- function(P-fract, exudates)` in which you can specify the P-fractions of interest, in case you do not want to see all of them, and the exudates of interest. This function will find a correlation for each data point as well as the correlations of the mean values calculated according to depths and land use types. It will return the correlations in a table that also denotes the soil sampling site and depth. 

With these correlations, I would like to examine the patterns of correlation across soil depth and landuse type. For this, I would like to make plots showing soil depth vs. correlation between P-fraction and exudate for each land use type. For this I might want `soil_plot <- function(relate, landuse)` into which I specify which of the relationships from the `soil_corr` table I want to plot against soil depth, as well as the land use type of interest for the plot. The landuse argument will be able to take multiple arguments such that the hardwood landuse and the pine forest land use can be plotted on the same soil depth graph.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
